    When you run this command:

        <%= $program %> --help

    You will see this output:

  %|section "Ruby library interface"
    Begin by loading <%= $project %> into Ruby:

    <code>
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'ember'
    </code>

    Instantiate a template processor:

    <code>
    source   = "your eRuby template here"
    options  = { :unindent => true, :shorthand => true }

    template = Ember::Template.new(source, options)
    </code>

    Inspect the Ruby program that is used to evaluate the eRuby template:

    <code>
    puts template.program
    </code>

    View the result of evaluating the eRuby template:

    <code>
    puts template.render
    </code>

    See the [API documentation](<%= api_url %>) for details and examples.

  %|section "eRuby template directives", "Directives"
    eRuby templates are plain-text documents that contain special processing instructions known as **directives**.  Directives may be expressed using either **standard** or **shorthand** notation:

    | Notation  | Directive | Head | Operation | Body | Tail |
    | --------  | --------- | ---- | --------- | ---- | ---- |
    | Standard  | <%%XY%>   | <%%  | X         | Y    | %>   |
    | Shorthand | %XY       | %    | X         | Y    |      |

    In standard notation, the directive is composed of a head, <%= xref "Operations", "an operation" %>, a body, and a tail.  Furthermore, the directive may appear anywhere in the text, except within another directive.

    In shorthand notation, the directive is composed of a head, <%= xref "Operations", "an operation" %> and a body.  Furthermore, the directive may only appear in the text if it occupies an entire line.

    %|section "Operations"
      The first character that follows the head of a directive is known as an **operation**.  Operations specify how the directive should be processed:

      | Operation                                              | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
