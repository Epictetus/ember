    %|section "Version 0.0.1 (2009-10-03)"

      This release improves Ruby 1.9 support and revises the user manual.


      %|paragraph "Bug fixes"

        * Nested templates could not access parent's binding in Ruby 1.9


      %|paragraph "Housekeeping"

        * Use simpler Copyright reminder at the top of every file.

        * Rename internal `Program` class' methods to be self-documenting.

        * Open source is for fun, so [be nice](http://loiclemeur.com/english/2009/03/never-criticize-your-competitors.html): speak of "related works" instead of "competitors".
